Practical assignment for HulkApps

I divided the entire process into a set of 5 pages-
    1- LoginPage
    2- HomePage
    3- CatalogPage
    4- ProductPage
    5- CartPage

With all the required actions and identifiers in the beginning of the code

Then i designed the featurefile that can be easily understood by non-technical personell, and can also be easily customised by them (eg the code will run for first 'n' products)

Following that a stepdefinition file was created which had lines of code corresponding to each step in the feature file
